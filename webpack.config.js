  Webpack brings interesting features:
    * Have all the static resources (CSS, images, fonts) as module,
    * Integrate and consume third-party libraries very simply as a module,
    * Separate your build into multiple pieces, loaded on demand,
    * Keep an initial load very fast if needed,
    * Customize most of the steps in the process.
  It proposes a loader system which allows to transform anything and everything into JavaScript 
  (but not that). Thus, everything is consumable as a module.
  If you use the css-loader for example, all the url () directives will behave as require (), 
  so you can apply loaders to all your assets and you will have compile errors if a resource is 
  missing.
